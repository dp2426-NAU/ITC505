<h3>SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.</h3>

<p><i>Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO</i></p>

<b>PHILO</b>
<blockquote>
    Nay, but this dotage of our general's<br>
    O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,<br>
    That o'er the files and musters of the war<br>
    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,<br>
    The office and devotion of their view<br>
    Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,<br>
    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst<br>
    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,<br>
    And is become the bellows and the fan<br>
    To cool a gipsy's lust.
</blockquote>

<p><i>Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her</i></p>

<b>PHILO</b>
<blockquote>
    Look, where they come:<br>
    Take but good note, and you shall see in him.<br>
    The triple pillar of the world transform'd<br>
    Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.
</blockquote>

<b>CLEOPATRA</b>
<blockquote>
    If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
</blockquote>

<b>MARK ANTONY</b>
<blockquote>
    There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
</blockquote>

<b>CLEOPATRA</b>
<blockquote>
    I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
</blockquote>

<b>MARK ANTONY</b>
<blockquote>
    Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
</blockquote>

<p><i>Enter an Attendant</i></p>

<b>Attendant</b>
<blockquote>
    News, my good lord, from Rome.
</blockquote>

<b>MARK ANTONY</b>
<blockquote>
    Grates me: the sum.
</blockquote>

<b>CLEOPATRA</b>
<blockquote>
    Nay, hear them, Antony:<br>
    Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows<br>
    If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent<br>
    His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;<br>
    Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;<br>
    Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'
</blockquote>

<b>MARK ANTONY</b>
<blockquote>
    How, my love!
</blockquote>

<b>CLEOPATRA</b>
<blockquote>
    Perchance! nay, and most like:<br>
    You must not stay here longer, your dismission<br>
    Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.<br>
    Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?<br>
    Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,<br>
    Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine<br>
    Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame<br>
    When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
</blockquote>

<b>MARK ANTONY</b>
<blockquote>
    Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch<br>
    Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.<br>
    Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike<br>
    Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life<br>
    Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair<br>
    <i>Embracing</i><br>
    And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,<br>
    On pain of punishment, the world to weet<br>
    We stand up peerless.
</blockquote>

<b>CLEOPATRA</b>
<blockquote>
    Excellent falsehood!<br>
    Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?<br>
    I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony<br>
    Will be himself.
</blockquote>

<b>MARK ANTONY</b>
<blockquote>
    But stirr'd by Cleopatra.<br>
    Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,<br>
    Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:<br>
    There's not a minute of our lives should stretch<br>
    Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
</blockquote>

<b>CLEOPATRA</b>
<blockquote>
    Hear the ambassadors.
</blockquote>

<b>MARK ANTONY</b>
<blockquote>
    Fie, wrangling queen!<br>
    Whom everything becomes, to chide, to laugh,<br>
    To weep; whose every passion fully strives<br>
    To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!<br>
    No messenger, but thine; and all alone<br>
    To-night we'll wander through the streets and note<br>
    The qualities of people. Come, my queen;<br>
    Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.
</blockquote>

<p><i>Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with their train</i></p>

<b>DEMETRIUS</b>
<blockquote>
    Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
</blockquote>

<b>PHILO</b>
<blockquote>
    Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,<br>
    He comes too short of that great property<br>
    Which still should go with Antony.
</blockquote>

<b>DEMETRIUS</b>
<blockquote>
    I am full sorry<br>
    That he approves the common liar, who<br>
    Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope<br>
    Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!
